# Welcome to the contributing guide

Pull Requests are very much welcome, but cannot readily change normative content.

## Architecture

The final website is rendered using GitHub Pages, which uses Jekyll.
It consists of some templates and some data files that those templates use.
Some templates are rendered on the basis of the normative linked data files, using custom Python 3.9 scripts.
